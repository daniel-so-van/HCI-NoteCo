##
As part of the NoteCo team, I was actively involved in the design phase of the application. I helped create the initial wireframes and contributed to decisions around layout, color scheme, and user interface elements to ensure a mobile-friendly experience. During the review phase, I collaborated on producing a demonstration to showcase the key features of NoteCo, focusing on clarity and ease of use for new users. I also took part in preparing the final slide presentation, organizing the content and visuals to clearly communicate our app's purpose, design process, and key features.
